# Conclusion & Grade Reflections

Throughout this portfolio, I’ve illustrated that I’m on the path to earn an A in this course. 
 I understand the basics and have foundational statistical computing skills.

**Here are my artifacts and skills set evidence:**


#### **Import, manage, and clean data** & **Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs**
-	My *[Retrieve, Wrangle, Mutate, Merge](https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/Guides_Create_Covid_Census)* guide documents my ability to transform data from two separate open source hosts through an API, and retrieve the most current numbers at a click of a button. 
    -	In this document, I outline how to leverage the ::tidyverse:: and ::tidycensus:: packages to discover the population trends of Michigan counties, and tidy up variables to join the datasets. 

#### **Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations**
-	From there, I’ve provided readers with a summary of findings in the *[Exploring the Data With Summary Stats]( https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/Guides_Summary_Stats)*
document. I’ve created three tables in a ::shiny:: app for a county by county comparison that reveals the average differences from a socioeconomic and COVID-19 mortality rate perspective. 

    -	A needed improvement is utilizing a function to change variable names between their descriptive (a format lost in CSV form) and the “tidy” version. 

    -	In hindsight, an embedded table on a website would provide for an easier user experience, I hope to make that change in an upcoming update. **[Here](https://073308-brooke.shinyapps.io/MIShiny/)** is the current table artifact.
    

-	*[Exploring the Data with Scatter Plots]( https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/Guides_Scatter_Plots)* demonstrates how to utilize the ::plotly:: package to visualize and explore the relationship between two variables. (*note: this document will be revised. I'll break up the code chunks so they can easily be read in HTML format*)

    - I segmented the data into quintiles to reveal at a glance the differences of Michigan county population composition based on COVID-19 mortality, and created my own quintile color palette for graphic consistency. I love the ability of ::plotly:: to provide labels via hovering over the plot of interest. It allows the end user to understand more about the variable without cluttering up the graphs.
  
     -	Here are the Michigan plots in their current form: 
        - [COVID-19 Mortality by Public Housing Assistance Rate](https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/plots_pubassistance)
  	    - [COVID-19 Mortality by Median Age](https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/plots_medianage)
        - [COVID-19 Mortality by Median Income](https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/plots_income)
        - [COVID-19 Mortality by Higher Education attainment](https://rpubs.com/ekoorb03/plots_education) 
          
    -	More sourcing and labeling is needed. 
    
#### **Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments**    
-	Lastly, by the final deadline, I will use these quintiles  to showcase my ability to create randomized experiments. 


One last note on my growth, I've started receiving complaints about the clanking coming out of my office... all from the sound of typing. My study hours haven't changed, but it is time to buy a quieter keyboard for coding sessions.
 I'll take that as a complement, and a mark of gained proficiency.
