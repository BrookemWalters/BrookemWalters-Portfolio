# Conclusion & Grade Reflections 
Throughout this document, I’ve illustrated that I’m on the path to earn an A in this course. 
On the topics we’ve covered so far, I understand the basics and I’m building the foundation to improve my statistical computing skills. Although it was a bit of a rocky start, I have found a workflow that matches my learning style. 

I understand there is still a lot of work to do! I need to get a better grasp of functions, working with missing values, and making my lines of code more concise. There is still so much to learn and apply regarding formatting! I recognize the need to spend more time with Github, understand the nuances and clean up my online presence there. I look forward to learning the Shiny package, and leveling up this portfolio. 

One last note on my growth, I've started receiving complaints about the clanking coming out of my office... all from the sound of typing. My study hours haven't changed, but it is time to buy a quieter keyboard for coding sessions past 8pm :D \
 I'll take that as a complement, and a mark of gained proficiency.
