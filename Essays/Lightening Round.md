# Lightening Round

### *What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.*
Visualizing data with GG plot, there are so many nuances and Iâ€™m struggling to make my vision come to life in R Studio. This comes down to lack of experience. 

### *What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.*
Motivation. I truly appreciated the freedom to follow my curiosity and explore concepts at my own pace kept.

### *What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.*
At first configuring all of the different types of software was a frustration; between Teams GitHub, Gather, Blackboard, and Google Boards, there were a lot of variable to account for.  It took some time to get a workflow down, but what surprised me is I actually like Gather, I shared the platform functionality with my best friend, a middle school teacher,  who was stuck in Zoom purgatory. Professionally, I've started using live version control for MS Excel and Word reports. I realize this is the way things are going. It is better I change with the times than get left behind. 

### *Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.*
I advise students to code along with the book beyond reading. Additionally, seek out other sources of information if the recommended material does not work for your learning style. There's a lot of free material out there.
