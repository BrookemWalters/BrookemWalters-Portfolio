# Lightening Round

### *What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.*
Visualizing data with GG plot, there are so many nuances and Iâ€™m struggling to make my vision come to life in R Studio. This comes down to lack of experience. 

### *What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.*
The easiest part of the class  are the data primers, because of the real time feedback and solutions

### *What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.*
I was a bit annoyed at first with the different types of software we are using. Between teams, GitHub, Gather, Blackboard, and Google Boards... it was a lot.  It took some time to get a workflow down, but what surprised me is I actually like Gather, I shared the platform functionality with a teacher friend of mine who is stuck in Zoom hell. Professionally, my new director insists on live version control for excel and word documents. I realize this is the way things are going. It is better I change with the times than get left behind. 

### *Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.*
I advise them to actually follow along with the book beyond reading. The only way to get better at RStudio is to actually code.
