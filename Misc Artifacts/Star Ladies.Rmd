```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


For the Star Wars table assignment, I thought it would be interesting to explore the breakdown of feminine characters. Here is my exploratory analysis where I:

-`create tables` 
-`create barcharts`
-`calculate the five-number-summary of a variable`
-`create side by side box plots`


First install the `{Tidyverse}` 

```{r find and filter}
library(tidyverse)

#filter by female, and select a couple of characteristics for comparison
sw_lady <-starwars %>% 
  filter( gender == "feminine") %>% 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  select(name, birth_year, homeworld, species, height, hair_color, eye_color, skin_color)
sw_lady
```

Time to summarize the list into a table!
Install the `{gt}` package in the console

```{r load the gt library}
library(gt)
```


```{r create table of female star wars characters}
sw_lady_plain <- 
sw_lady %>% 
  gt()

sw_lady_plain
```
##### I can document my code
I used [Introduction to Creating gt Tables](https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/intro-creating-gt-tables.html) walk through to jazz up the table.  
Additionally,  I found inspiration from R Studio's [Table Battles](https://youtu.be/-c_PUee8Cu0).


```{r jazz up the table}
sw_lady_pretty <- 
 sw_lady %>% 
  gt() %>% 
 
# Add a header
   tab_header (
    title = md("The *17* Feminine Characters of Star Wars"),
    subtitle = md("stats and facts")
  ) %>% 
  opt_align_table_header(align = "left") %>% 
    tab_source_note(
    source_note = md( "Dataset is from the `starwars` **R** package") 
  ) %>% 
  
#Clean up the column headers  
  opt_all_caps() %>% 
  cols_label(
    name = "Name",
    birth_year = "Birth Year",
    homeworld = "Homeworld",
    species = "Species",
    height = "Height",
    hair_color = "Hair Color",
    skin_color = "Skin Color",
    eye_color = "Eye Color",
    ) %>% 
  cols_width(
    name ~ px(200),
    birth_year ~px(100),
    species ~ px(200),
    height ~ px(200),
    hair_color ~ px(100),
    eye_color ~ px(100),
    skin_color ~ px(200),
  ) %>% 
  
# call out the character with the most missing features
   tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("*Little is known about Rey*")
  ) %>%   
  tab_style(
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = everything(),
      rows = 13
    ),
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color="#CC0033"),
      cell_text( color = "white")
       ))
 
sw_lady_pretty
```


After making the initial table, I was intrigued to learn that there are only 16 female / 17 feminine characters in the entire data set. I was curious to see what the breakdown of male to female  by species type. 
So let’s make a table using the unfiltered data. 


```{r create stacked bar charts}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = species, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Gender Composition by Species") 
```

Reviewing this chart, we can observe a few trends: 
* the majority of species only have one  character 
* the vast majority of characters are male (we already knew this from the table) 
* the Mirialan species  is unique, this species only has two characters, both of which are female 
* humans represent most characters 


I'd like to make it easier to determine which species has the largest percentage of female characters.
I know there is a better way to do this, I'll need to explore this more!
Here's my attempt: 

```{r data wrangling }
gender_comp <- starwars %>% 
  group_by(gender, species) %>% 
  summarise(gender_count = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = gender,
              values_from = gender_count) %>% 
#reduce the table to species with fem characters  
  filter(feminine > 0)
 #create new column for fem to masc ratio
 
```

This gets me closer, to understanding the gender composition at a glance, but I'd prefer to see the percentages
I'll make a few new columns.

```{r Creating calculations and new variables}
gender_comp <-  gender_comp %>% 
#mutate(fem_perc =  feminine / (feminine + masculine, na.rm = TRUE)) this failed?? another opportunity to learn how to do this the correct way.
  mutate(masculine = replace_na(masculine, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(spec_perc_fem = feminine / (feminine + masculine)) %>% 
  mutate(fem_charc_count =  feminine) %>% 
#omit the irrelevant columns
  select(species, fem_charc_count, spec_perc_fem) %>% 
  arrange(desc(fem_charc_count))
gender_comp
```

```{r gender comp by species table}
gender_comp %>% 
  gt() %>% 
# Add a header
   tab_header (
    title = md(" Percentage Feminine Characters of Star Wars"),
    subtitle = md("*by species*")
  ) %>% 
  #clean up the columns
   opt_all_caps() %>% 
  cols_label(
    species = "Species",
    fem_charc_count = "Total Fem Characters",
    spec_perc_fem = "% Fem",
  ) %>% 
  #add a few notes
  opt_align_table_header(align = "left") %>% 
    tab_source_note(
    source_note = md( "Dataset is from the `starwars` **R** package") 
  ) %>% 
    tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("**how to read:** 25.7% of human characters are feminine")
  ) 
```


Ideally, I'd format this table to show the decimals as a percentage, that is a new skill I must learn another day. 


Lastly, while I am here, I should demonstrate a five number summary. It's probably best not to use my ghastly **percentage female variable**, as I've omitted the N/A and replaced them with zeros, and the data will  be skewed.

**Instead,** let's compare the mass of everyone.

```{r fivenumber summary}
chunkywars <-  starwars %>% 
  select(mass) %>% 
  fivenum()
chunkywars  
```

Beautiful, there is one Chonker of a creature coming in a 1358.0 (lbs?? I'm not sure)

```{r find the Chonker}
filter(starwars, mass == 1358)
```
#### I can use outside resources to troubleshoot
And for grand finale of Chunky Wars, side by side box plots!

```{r bad box plot}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = mass, x = gender, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Okay this is messy and more disturbing than cargo pants. 


```{r box plots without species}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = mass, x = gender, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

This is better but still hideous! Jabba is **ruining** my plot!
I'll take him out of the equation, and a header and  **voilà**  
We can see at a glance  that the median weight for masculine characters is roughly 25 units more than femininie characters

```{r box plot without outliers}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = mass, x = gender, fill = gender)) +
 geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
 coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 105)) +
  labs(title = "Mass by Gender") 
```

Thanks [Statology](https://www.statology.org/remove-outliers-in-boxplots-r/) for help removing the outliers.
Ideally, I'd like to reformat the scale to include the chonker and still have the plot be readable. 
This is another skill to add to the growing "to-do list". 

Below is the before and after of the box plots:
