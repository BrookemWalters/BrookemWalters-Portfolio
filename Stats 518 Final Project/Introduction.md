# Introduction to Michigan Counties in a Pandemic

At the age of 16, my grandmother “Nana” left her parents and 10 siblings behind in pursuit of a better life in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents were sharecroppers, and if you know anything about 1950’s Alabama – life wasn’t exactly ideal for a young black woman. 

Upon moving north, Nana had the good fortune of meeting Betty, who was secretly dating a well to do judge. Betty’s boyfriend bought her a house in a white middleclass neighborhood… This was a HUGE scandal. You see, blacks were not “allowed” to own property in that part of town. Betty’s boyfriend found a loophole. According to my grandmother, the neighbors were completely beside themselves, and promptly vacated the neighborhood.

My grandmother bought the home next to Betty for a fraction of the cost by the distraught homeowners. By the time my father was born, the neighborhood shifted into a black middleclass west Michigan neighborhood. Nana still lives in this home today. 
 
I share this story to provide a little context for any bias I hold onto during my analysis of the 2019 American Survey and John Hopkins Covid morbidity data. Like many, I understand how a zip code profoundly shapes quality of life. 

As I built the scatter plots and summarized the variables, I did my best to let this notion go and let the data speak for itself. 
Exploring the data taught me so much about Michigan counties! I’ve built interactive tables and plots that highlight the demographics and loss of life due to Covid-19. The story drastically changes county by county. 

Going into this, admittedly I was pretty ignorant of my home state.

**Here are a few things I learned throughout this project:**
- There is a county in Michigan that is 16% Native American (most are under 1%)
- There is a county that is 50% non-white, it’s also the same county that has the highest percentage of households on public assistance and falls into the 4th quintile for Covid-19 deaths per thousand. 
- The county with the highest percentage college graduates, also has the highest percentage of Asians, has one of the lowest median ages and the top third highest income. This county falls in the lowest quintile for Covid-19 deaths.

By the next deadline, the correlation between county demographic composition and Covid-19 morbidly will be explored further. 

I hope you find this data fascinating, and provides you with a new insight into Michigan counties.
