## Introduction to COVID-19 Michigan Mortality & Socioeconomic Trends

At the age of 16, my grandmother “Nana” left her parents and nine siblings behind in pursuit of a better life in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents were sharecroppers, and if you know anything about 1950’s Mississippi – life wasn’t exactly ideal for a young black woman. 

Upon moving north, Nana had the good fortune of meeting Betty, who was secretly dating a well-to-do judge. Betty’s boyfriend bought her a house in a white middle-class neighborhood… This was a HUGE scandal. You see, blacks were not “*allowed*” to own property in that part of town. Betty’s boyfriend found a loophole. According to my grandmother, the neighbors were completely beside themselves, and promptly vacated the area.

My grandmother bought the home next to Betty for a fraction of the cost by the distraught homeowners. By the time my father was born, the community shifted into a black middle-class West Michigan neighborhood. In the 1980's, a large public housing project was proposed and constructed next to my grandmother's home, and the community evolved again. Nana still lives here today. 

### Acknowledging Bias
I share this story to disclose my potential bias that may shape my analysis of the 2016-2020 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) and the COVID-19 data provided by [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Like many, I understand how a zip code profoundly shapes quality of life. 
As I built the scatter plots and summarized the variables, I did my best to let this notion go and let the data speak for itself.

### Why this topic?
The global collaboration to document and report the status of the pandemic over the last few years is truly remarkable. However, the longer the quarantine went on, 
the more I focused inward. **During the pandemic I:**
- Returned from a year abroad
- Ended my 8 year military career
- Got married
- Had my first child
- Bought a house
- Enrolled in grad school
- Changed careers

These factors do not excuse my ignorance, but perhaps will shed light regarding my topic choice.  

While I had a peripheral understanding of COVID-19’s devastating impact on the world at large, I was blind to many of the state-wide implications. 
This project is an attempt to rectify my knowledge gap, and inform others in a similar position.


Throughout this process I learned so much about Michigan! In terms of demographics, Michigan counties vary widely. Admittedly, I was pretty ignorant of my home state.
I hope my work provides you with a new perspective into Michigan counties.
