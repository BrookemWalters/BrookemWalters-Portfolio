## Introduction to COVID-19 Michigan Mortality & Socioeconomic Trends

At the age of 16, my grandmother “Nana” left her parents and ten siblings behind in pursuit of a better life in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents were sharecroppers, and if you know anything about 1950’s Mississippi – life wasn’t exactly ideal for a young black woman. 

Upon moving north, Nana had the good fortune of meeting Betty, who was secretly dating a well-to-do judge. Betty’s boyfriend bought her a house in a white middle-class neighborhood… This was a HUGE scandal. You see, blacks were not “*allowed*” to own property in that part of town. Betty’s boyfriend found a loophole. According to my grandmother, the neighbors were completely beside themselves, and promptly vacated the area.

My grandmother bought the home next to Betty for a fraction of the cost by the distraught homeowners. By the time my father was born, the community shifted into a black middle-class West Michigan neighborhood. In the late 80's a large public housing project was proposed and constructed next to my grandmother's home, and the community evolved again. Nana still lives here today. 

### About This Project 
I share this story to disclose my potential bias that may shape my analysis of the 2019 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) and the Covid-19 data provided by  [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Like many, I understand how a zip code profoundly shapes quality of life. 
As I built the scatter plots and summarized the variables, I did my best to let this notion go and let the data speak for itself.

Throughout this process I learned so much about Michigan! In terms of demographics, Michigan counties vary widely. Admittedly, I was pretty ignorant of my home state.
The final summary is [here](https://github.com/BrookemWalters/BrookemWalters-Portfolio/blob/main/Stats%20518%20Final%20Project/Summary%20of%20Findings.md#covid-19-mortality-and-socioeconomic-trends-in-michigan-by-county).


**Here are a few things I learned throughout this project:**
- There is a county in Michigan that is 16% Native American (the median percentage in MI is under 1%).
- There is a county that is 50% non-white, it’s also the same county that has the highest percentage of households on public assistance and falls into the 4th quintile for Covid-19 deaths per thousand. 
- The county with the highest percentage of college graduates, also has the highest percentage of Asians, has one of the lowest median ages and ranks third for highest income in Michigan. This county falls in the lowest quintile for Covid-19 deaths.

This report holds interactive tables and scatter plots for you to explore.
By the next deadline, the correlation between county demographic composition and Covid-19 mortality will be explored further. 

I hope my work provides you with a new perspective into Michigan counties.
