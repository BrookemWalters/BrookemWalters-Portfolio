# Introduction to  Michigan Counties and Covid 19 

At the age of 16, my grandmother “Nana” left her parents and ten siblings behind in pursuit of a better life in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents were sharecroppers, and if you know anything about 1950’s Alabama – life wasn’t exactly ideal for a young black woman. 

Upon moving north, Nana had the good fortune of meeting Betty, who was secretly dating a well-to-do judge. Betty’s boyfriend bought her a house in a white middle-class neighborhood… This was a HUGE scandal. You see, blacks were not “*allowed*” to own property in that part of town. Betty’s boyfriend found a loophole. According to my grandmother, the neighbors were completely beside themselves, and promptly vacated the neighborhood.

My grandmother bought the home next to Betty for a fraction of the cost by the distraught homeowners. By the time my father was born, the neighborhood shifted into a black middle-class west Michigan neighborhood. Nana still lives in this home today. I wonder how her life would have turned out if she'd remained in the south, her zip code changed everything. 

### About This Project 
I share this story to disclose my potential bias that may shape my analysis of the 2019 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) and the Covid-19 data provided by  [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Like many, I understand how a community profoundly shapes quality of life. 
As I built the scatter plots and summarized the variables, I did my best to let this notion go and let the data speak for itself.


Throughout this process I learned so much about Michigan! In terms of demographics, Michigan counties vary widely. Admittedly, I was pretty ignorant of my home state.

**Here are a few things I learned throughout this project:**
- There is a county in Michigan that is 16% Native American (the median percentage in MI is under 1%).
- There is a county that is 50% non-white, it’s also the same county that has the highest percentage of households on public assistance and falls into the 4th quintile for Covid-19 deaths per thousand. 
- The county with the highest percentage college graduates, also has the highest percentage of Asians, has one of the lowest median ages and ranks third for highest income in Michigan. This county falls in the lowest quintile for Covid-19 deaths.

This report holds interactive tables and scatter plots for you to explore.
By the next deadline, the correlation between county demographic composition and Covid-19 mortality will be explored further. 

I hope you my work provides you with a new perspective into Michigan counties
