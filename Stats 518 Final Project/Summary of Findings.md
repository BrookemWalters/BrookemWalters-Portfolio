# COVID-19 Mortality & Socioeconomic Trends in Michigan, by County
My Stat 518 project seeks to understand the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and socioeconomic variables in Michigan counties. \
***Note:***  *This is a work in progress, and more analysis is needed to compute the statistical significance of the findings. (And I need to add sourcing to the plots!)*

## **Project Description:**
**My script automates the following:**

- **Collects** and aggregates the most recent cumulative count of COVID-19 deaths for Michigan by county 
- **Calculates** COVID-19 deaths per thousand
- **Groups** the 83 counties of Michigan into 5 risk segments (quintiles), 1 being the lowest rate of COVID-19 deaths
- **Connects** to the census.gov database and retrieves the latest population estimates
- **Compiles** the unemployment rate, education rate, median income, median age, and county racial compositions
- **Joins** the two datasets together via county
- **Reveals** the summary statistics of the numeric variables 
- **Vizualizes** the data into tables and scatter plots 
- **To Do**
   - side by side box plots of quintiles by race
   - bootstrapping -> can I use the unemployment rate to predict COVID-19 percentile???

*As of July 23rd 2022, this data reflects COVID-19 deaths as of July 20th 2022, I'll update the script to automate the date in the sourcing.*

## How To Use

There are five sites to visit, one shiny table, and four interactive scatter plots: follow the **[ ** click ** ]** link to explore the data. 

#### [** Click ME **](https://073308-brooke.shinyapps.io/MIShiny/) Table of County Demographics and COVID-19 Mortality
On the table, there are three tabs: 
- **Summary Statistics:** This can be used as a point of reference when asking *"How does this county compare to the rest?"*
  - For example:
    -	*Does a county skew young or old?* 
    -	*Whatâ€™s the average unemployment rate in Michigan?*
    -	*What is the highest county [public assistance rate](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/public-assistance/about.html)?* 
- **All the Michigan County Data** [*a working title*]
  -	Here you will find a list of all US counties and their key socioeconomic figures side by side.
  -	You can search, filter, and sort to answers questions like:
    -	*Which county had the highest COVID-19 deaths and what is the median age of the residents there?*
    -	*Which county is the least diverse and how many COVID-19 deaths did they experience per 1,000?*
