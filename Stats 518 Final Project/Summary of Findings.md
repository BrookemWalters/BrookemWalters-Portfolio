# COVID-19 Mortality & Socioeconomic Trends in Michigan, by County

July 23, 2022

My Stat 518 project seeks to explore the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and socioeconomic variables in Michigan counties. \
***Note:***  *This is a work in progress, and more analysis is needed to compute the statistical significance of the findings.

**The source code is [here](https://github.com/BrookemWalters/BrookemWalters-Portfolio/tree/main/Stats%20518%20Final%20Project/exploring%20the%20data).**


## **Project Description:**
**My script automates the following:**

- **Collects** and aggregates the most recent cumulative count of COVID-19 deaths for Michigan by county 
- **Calculates** COVID-19 deaths per thousand
- **Groups** the 83 counties of Michigan into 5 risk segments (quintiles), 1 being the lowest rate of COVID-19 deaths
- **Connects** to the census.gov database and retrieves the latest population estimates
- **Compiles** the unemployment rate, education rate, median income, median age, and county racial compositions
- **Joins** the two datasets together via county
- **Reveals** the summary statistics of the numeric variables
- **Vizualizes** the data into tables and scatter plots 
- **To Do**
   - side by side box plots of quintiles by race
   - bootstrapping -> can I use the unemployment rate to predict COVID-19 percentile???

*As of July 30th 2022, this data reflects COVID-19 deaths as of July 28th 2022*

#### [{ Click ME 1 }](https://073308-brooke.shinyapps.io/MIShiny/) Table of County Demographics and COVID-19 Mortality
#### The Tables Explained: 
- **Summary Statistics:** Use this as a point of reference when considering *"How does this county compare to the rest?"*
  - For example:
    -	*Does a county skew young or old?* 
    -	*Whatâ€™s the average unemployment rate in Michigan?*
    -	*What is the highest county [public assistance rate](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/public-assistance/about.html)?* 
- **All the Michigan County Data:**
  -	Here you will find a list of all MI counties and their key socioeconomic figures side by side
  -	You can search, filter, and sort my entire county-COVID dataset
- **COVID-19 Mortality Quintile (Q1 through Q5):**
   - This final table allows you to compare the socioeconomic differences between a Q1 county, a county with the lowest COVID-19 mortality rate, and the highest rate (Q5)
#### The Findings:
With an average of 2.4 deaths per thousand, counties in the first quintile (Q1), look radically different than the other end of the spectrum:

Here are a few traits of the average Q1 county:
- medium sized populations
- younger residents
- highly educated residents
- the highest median income of all the quintiles
- racially diverse
- the least amount of unemployment
- the least amount of households on public assistance

**Example Q1 counties include**
- Kent
- Alger
- Grand Traverse
- Kalamazoo
- Marquette

## Scatter Plots
The interactive graphs show the relationship between one socioeconomic variable and the COVID-19 mortality rate. 
After clicking on the link, hover over a plot to learn more about each county. 
The larger the bubble, the more deaths that county experienced. The higher the quintile, the more death the county experienced per 1000.
